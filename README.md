PROJECT STILL IN PROGRESS! <br>
<b>Description:</b> Artificial Neural Network in the C programming language; employs the ReLU and Softmax activation-functions. Does not rely on tools like Scikit-learn.

<b>Currently implemented:</b> forward pass, activation functions (ReLU, Softmax), Mean-Squared-Error error calculation, gradient-descent, recurrence<br>
<b>Yet to implement:</b> a function that traces how much each neuron contributed to the overall Mean-Squared-Error<br>

Thank you for your attention.
