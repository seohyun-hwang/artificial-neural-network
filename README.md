PROJECT STILL IN PROGRESS! <br>
<b>Description:</b> Artificial Neural Network in the C programming language; employs the ReLU and Softmax activation-functions. Does not rely on Scikit-learn.

Currently implemented: forward pass, activation functions (ReLU, Softmax), Mean-Squared-Error error calculation
Note: the backprop procedure currently reconfigures the output values of each neuron. I will later modify this procedure to reconfigure weights and biases.

Thank you for your attention.
